### What to Know Regading Properties and Methods
_Try_ </br>
A try block is used to encapsulate a region of code. If any code throws an exception within that try block, the exception will be handled by the corresponding catch.</br>
_Catch_ </br>
When an exception occurs, the Catch block of code is executed. This is where you are able to handle the exception, log it, or ignore it.</br>
_Finally_
The finally block allows you to execute certain code if an exception is thrown or not. For example, disposing of an object that must be disposed of.</br>
_Throw_</br>
The throw keyword is used to actually create a new exception that is the bubbled up to a try catch finally block.</br>
